If you're here, you're definitely curious, and you're most likely going to be disappointed. This project is a millionth attempt at fixing the infamous "What do you want to eat this week?" question. Who's more objective than JavaScript to help gf and I put together a weekly food schedule.

## Getting started

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:m4thieulavoie/what-do-we-eat.git
```

### Install dependencies

Then, to init the project

```bash
cd what-do-we-eat
npm install
```

### Start the project

If you want to run the project, simply run

```bash
npm start
```

`Webpack` will then indicate you to open `localhost:3000`. When you'll do so, you'll see the project running.
